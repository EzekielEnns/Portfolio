# Portfolio
This was my first time working with the react framework
I include this here becuase I want to show off my ability to 
not only learn a new framework but building a webapp from the ground up
since nothing on this site is from a premade template
## What I learned
- react class and function components
- hooks, useState, useEffect
- npm packages 
- react-router-dom
- styled-components
- Single-responsibility principle
