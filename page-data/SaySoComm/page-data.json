When I started at SaySo an ambious telehealth startup aiming \nto reveultionize speach theorpy by remotly connecting doctor to patient I was green as can be \nbut I knew how to code and was ready to knock some socks. \n\nThe team had a react front end which was handed to me no questions asked. I should mention prior \nto this job I had about a year of learning react and docker under my belt so the team was just \nhappy to have someone with understanding looking at the project. \n\nIm not gonna lie it was overwhealming esspially with so many bugs and errors popping up.\nBeing from the IT industry I rolled up my sleves and started rooting out bugs and errors.\nstarting with the **asyn errors** like memeory leaks and hanging hooks, then moving to \n**stylistic Errors** like haivng one component controll five diffrent things.\n\nIn retospect fixing all these bugs right out of the gate was good but I should have managed \nmy scope better, I noticed as soon as I delt with an issue there was always five more things I had \ntodo, Instead of going on these crazy sprints where I rewrite massive parts of the frontend it \nwould have been better to break down those massive projects into tiny projects that could be achomplished\nquickly and allow me to manage other tickets that needed my attion.\n\n\nWhen the CEO offered me access to the backend to fix some bugs I was egar to try out AWS.\nI had worked with cloud computing a little bit at my previous contract as an Systems  Administartor. \nIt was so cool to see all the skills i'd learn as a IT contractor like the OSI modual, virtualization\nrouting, networks... all of it just transfered seemlessly needing only a bit googling to learn\nhow to apply the skill in question for the task.\n\nAfter cracking open the CDK I was shcoked to find the code nearly unreadable. It was using a series\nof helper functions this in trun ended up hiding the file locations of our lambdas source code.\nSo I rolled up my sleves and started rewriting 1000s of line of code. This was me spreading myself \nthin, I should have fixed the major slow downs like using *node:fs* and broken down each refactor \ninto tiny bits I could deal with inbetween important tasks.\n\nOnce I got through the issues that held me back I was able to start resturcting data flows from \ncogntio to database, fixing and deploying API's and implementing a build system into our pipeline\nallow for a future migration to typescript. I also started the process of implementing testing.\n"}]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
