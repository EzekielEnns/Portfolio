      When a map feature started crashing for users with too much data, I fixed
      it by clustering nearby hotels together and only rendering what was
      needed. This involved building my own DBSCAN algorithm and using smart
      rendering techniques. The end result: the map loads smoothly, even with
      tons of hotelsâ€”no more crashes.
