# Problem
My dyslexia and ADHD makes it easy to get distracted, Things like resizing windows,
finding program icons, and opening project folders are really distracting. As well
I tend to want to try out and build random repos which results in bad dependencies getting 
installed on my machine, (*im looking at you openssl 1.0*)

# Outcomes
I found the following tools that helped:
- NixOs: constant config across machines and no bad dependencies 
- i3wm: tile window manager makes me not worry about window placement, 
using league of legends like keybindings reuses my muscle memeory.
- fzf and bash: a bash script that looks for default.nix files inside a projects folder and spawns
my editor setup (*kitty + neovim*)

# Conclusion
Nix is a hard os to follow, but if you sit down and learn it you will get a awesome 
workflow, my current workflow is perfect for me, and I look forward to ironing out the kinks
as I progress
