# Devops
I may not have alot of work that falls into this category but wow do I love it.
Setting up tools and frameworks and supporting your team with tools to make there lives easier
is a blast, reading the docs and writing guides its just alot of fun and I'm excited to 
see how much more devops I can squesze into my carreer
