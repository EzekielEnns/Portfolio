# whoami 
A programing enthusiast, a linux nerd and that guy who loves his job just a little to much.   
I've been progrmaing for about { (new Date()).getYear() - (new Date("2012-05-06")).getYear() }
years now and I've spent that time greedly trying out all sorts of tech

mostly focusing on **web development** and **servers**. 

# Education
even though most of my skills are **self taught** I've  
spent alot of time taking certs and going to post secondary 

#### Linux Professional Institute -1
I got this for a job back in 2015 and I haven't gotten enough of linux since,  
its come in handy and stands to prove I know my way around a terminal.

#### Computer Engineering Diploma
this was a 2 year course. The most useful skills I learned from this  
program was how to **indpently learn new tools** and **time managment**

<u> Topics covered: </u>
- **C#**: this was 90% of the course work 
- **PHP**: we went over RESTful and managing databases 
- **C**: were we programmed microprocessors 
- **SQL**: we worked with both relational and Non-Relational  
covering topics like normalization

## Bachelores of Computer Science 
currently my next big project I'm working on my *third year* of this course  
and I love every bit of it. I've never thought about  
abstracting problems the way my professors teach. It gets me excited  
trying to put these theoretical ideas to the test.
